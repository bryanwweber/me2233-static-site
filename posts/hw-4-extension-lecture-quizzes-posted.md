Class,

Some adjustments to the schedule over the next few weeks:

1. HW 4 has been extended to be due Sep. 27 at 12:00 PM, rather than Sep. 25.

2. As a consequence of the extension, **THERE WILL BE NO LATE SUBMISSIONS OF HW 4!** I will distribute the solutions immediately after the assignment is due so that you can study from them.

3. The lecture quizzes for Sep. 27 and Oct. 4 have been posted. You can do them whenever you would like before the due date. The material covered on these quizzes will not be included on Exam 1
